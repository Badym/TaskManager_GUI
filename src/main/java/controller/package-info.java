/**
 * The {@code controller} package contains the controller classes for the Task Manager GUI application.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This package includes classes responsible for managing the user interface logic, handling
 * user actions, and updating views. The controllers connect the user interface with the
 * underlying model classes, enabling interactions such as viewing, adding, editing, and
 * removing tasks and clients.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Key classes in this package include:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link MainViewController} - Controls the main view of the application.</li>
 *   <li>{@link TaskViewController} - Manages the task list view, allowing users to view and manage tasks.</li>
 *   <li>{@link ClientViewController} - Manages the client list view, displaying client details and enabling user actions on clients.</li>
 *   <li>{@link AddTaskViewController} - Provides functionality for adding new tasks to the task list.</li>
 *   <li>{@link AddClientViewController} - Provides functionality for adding new clients to the client list.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each controller interacts with the {@code model} package to access and manipulate the application data.
 * </p>
